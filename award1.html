        The Japanese Association is a nonprofit organization that aims to promote and enhance mutual understanding and friendship between Japan and other countries. One of the ways they achieve this is by awarding scholarships to international students who are interested in studying in Japan.

        The Japanese scholarship award is a highly prestigious award that recognizes outstanding students who have demonstrated academic excellence, leadership skills, and a strong commitment to promoting cultural exchange between Japan and their home country <br><br>

        One notable feature of Kinkakuji is its use of timber framing,
        a common method used in Japanese construction.
        This technique involves using interlocking wooden joints without the use of nails or metal fasteners,
        resulting in a seamless and sturdy structure.
        The temple's walls are made of a special type of clay called "wattle and daub," which is a mixture of mud,
        straw, and wood chips.
        This type of wall offers both insulation and durability, making it ideal for the Japanese climate.
        The temple's main building is covered in gold leaf,
        giving it a shimmering appearance that reflects beautifully in the surrounding pond.
        The gold-leaf coating is a distinct characteristic of Japanese architecture
        and is often used to decorate temples and other religious structures. <br><br><br>
