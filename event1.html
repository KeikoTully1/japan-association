        For this event, Professor Ito will explain about one of the beautiful Japanese Architecture in Japan. <br><br>
        Kinkakuji, also known as the "Golden Pavilion," is a famous temple located in Kyoto, Japan,
        and is considered one of the most iconic examples of Japanese architecture.
        The temple's design and construction showcase many unique features
        that are characteristic of traditional Japanese architecture. <br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        One notable feature of Kinkakuji is its use of timber framing,
        a common method used in Japanese construction.
        This technique involves using interlocking wooden joints without the use of nails or metal fasteners,
        resulting in a seamless and sturdy structure.
        The temple's walls are made of a special type of clay called "wattle and daub," which is a mixture of mud,
        straw, and wood chips.
        This type of wall offers both insulation and durability, making it ideal for the Japanese climate.
        The temple's main building is covered in gold leaf,
        giving it a shimmering appearance that reflects beautifully in the surrounding pond.
        The gold-leaf coating is a distinct characteristic of Japanese architecture
        and is often used to decorate temples and other religious structures. <br><br><br>
