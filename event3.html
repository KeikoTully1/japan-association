        For this event, Zoologist professor Sakamoto will explain her research about Japanese snow monkeys in Japan. <br><br>
        Japanese snow monkeys, also known as Japanese macaques, 
        are a type of monkey native to Japan. They are known for their thick fur coats and distinctive red faces. <br>
        They are called snow monkeys because they live in areas where snow covers the ground for several months each year. <br>

        One of the most famous behaviors of Japanese snow monkeys is their use of hot springs. 
        They are the only non-human primates in the world known to regularly use hot springs for bathing and relaxation.<br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        They are found in various habitats across Japan, including forests, mountains, and grasslands. 
        Their range extends from the northern island of Hokkaido to the southern island of Kyushu. <br><br><br>
